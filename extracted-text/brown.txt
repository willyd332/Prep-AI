In the United States, voters directly elect dozens of politicians: presidents, governors, legislators, mayors, and so on.
How do voters decide which politician to blame for which policy outcomes? Previous research on gubernatorial
approval has suggested that voters divide policy blame between governors and the president based on each ofﬁce’s
‘‘functional responsibilities’’—requiring that responsibilities are clear cut, which is seldom true. Using data from
four surveys, I show that voters actually divide responsibility for economic conditions in a partisan manner,
preferring to blame ofﬁcials from the opposing party when problems arise.

T he United States is unique among democracies

in the burden it imposes on its voters. Not
only are American elections frequent, but they
feature a dizzying number of choices. In California,
often an extreme example of this tendency, each voter
in 2006 had to evaluate thirteen proposed initiatives
in addition to candidates for seven statewide ofﬁces,
two Congressional ofﬁces, two state legislative ofﬁces,
and various judgeships. As if that were not enough,
most voters would also have found on their ballots
candidates for their city council, county board of
supervisors, school board, and other (often obscure)
local elected ofﬁces.

The difﬁculties created by such a complex hyper-
democratic system have given rise to entire literatures
dealing with voter fatigue, ballot roll-off, and voter
sophistication. However, the presence of so many
independently elected ofﬁcials, often with overlap-
ping responsibilities, creates an additional problem:
blame. Elections are thought
to provide a link
whereby voters can hold elected ofﬁcials responsible
for their activities in ofﬁce (Ferejohn 1986). But when
something goes wrong—unemployment
is high,
schools are failing, or crime is up—how do voters
know which of
to hold
responsible?

these politicians

all

To examine all the diverse and complicated layers
of authority in America’s federal system would be
beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, I pay primary
attention to the most prominent politician at each level
of American federalism: presidents and governors. I

am by no means the ﬁrst to explore this relationship;
indeed, several well-regarded publications have de-
bated how state and national conditions interact in
gubernatorial elections. The reigning argument at pres-
ent is that voters evaluate governors and presidents with
reference to each ofﬁce’s ‘‘functional responsibilities,’’
expecting presidents to provide national security and
Social Security while expecting governors to provide
education, highways, and prosperity (Arceneaux 2006;
Atkeson and Partin 1995, 2001).

is

However, this sort of argument fails to account
for the powerful and well-documented role that par-
tisanship plays in structuring American voters’ be-
havior. My argument, detailed below,
that
Americans rely heavily on partisan shortcuts when
deciding whether to hold their governor (as opposed
to the president) responsible for state-level policy
outcomes—especially when functional responsibility
for a particular policy area is shared by both the
governor and the president. Of course, it’s far from
novel to suggest that partisanship matters in Amer-
ican politics; previous research has shown abundantly
that voters tend to have more patience with politi-
cians of their own party than with politicians from
the other side. My major claim is not just that
partisanship matters, then, but rather that partisan-
ship helps determine which policy results get attrib-
uted to the governor and which get attributed to the
president. Previous work on gubernatorial elections
has erred by emphasizing functional responsibility
without also taking account of partisanship.

To be clear, I do not intend to argue that voters
will completely ignore the president’s and governor’s
actual functional responsibilities; even the least en-
gaged citizen should know that governors have as little
control over foreign policy as presidents have over
potholes. Rather, my argument is that partisan con-
siderations will inﬂuence allocations of blame in the
many policy areas where the president and the gover-
nor share responsibility—an argument I test by anal-
yzing responsibility for the state’s economy. When the
president and the governor belong to the same party,
there is not much opportunity for a partisan blame
game to develop between them. But when they belong
to different parties, a situation I refer to as ‘‘divided
federalism,’’ partisan voters gain the opportunity to
blame one for economic problems while giving the
other a free pass. Just as divided government creates a
potential blame game between the president and
Congress, divided federalism creates a similar situation
between the president and the governors.

I proceed now by brieﬂy reviewing the two main
literatures I draw on—the literatures on partisan bias
and on gubernatorial elections—and show how the
latter can beneﬁt by incorporating insights from the
former. I then explore three speciﬁc empirical im-
plications of this theoretical argument.

A Theory of Partisan Bias and

Divided Federalism

Studies of partisan bias began decades ago with the
psychological model
introduced in The American
Voter (Campbell et al. 1960); an updated take on this
argument is that voters simply reject information that
challenges their prior beliefs (Zaller 1992), or that
they choose to give greater credibility to information
from sources they trust (Lupia and McCubbins 1998;
Page, Shapiro, and Dempsey 1987), even if those
sources are potentially biased.

Regardless of which of these mechanisms produ-
ces partisan bias, we have evidence that the biases
exist. First, we have evidence that partisanship colors
voter evaluations of policy outcomes: Conover,
Feldman, and Knight have provided detailed evidence
that retrospective (1986) and prospective (1987)
economic evaluations strongly reﬂect respondents’
political views, arguing that these evaluations ‘‘be-
come extensions of partisan evaluations of the pres-
ident’s capabilities’’ (1987, 578; see also Bartels 2002).
A similar story arises with regard to consumer con-
ﬁdence surveys; although actual economic conditions

have a strong impact on consumer conﬁdence, poli-
tical evaluations also play a signiﬁcant role (De Boef
and Kellstedt 2004). In addition, we have evidence
that partisan factors inﬂuence whether voters will
consider economic conditions when voting in Con-
gressional elections
(Fiorina 1983; Hibbing and
Alford 1981).

These ﬁndings have come from research primarily
concerned with the national setting; these insights
have not been fully applied to the subnational context.
In fact, the second literature I draw on—the literature
on gubernatorial approval and elections—has largely
overlooked these results. Instead, most research in this
second literature has debated whether voters hold
governors accountable for local (i.e., state-level) con-
ditions or whether governors are entirely at the mercy
of the president’s coattails. Few dispute that national
partisan trends and national economic conditions
inﬂuence gubernatorial approval and elections; the
question has been whether local conditions, typically
operationalized with state economic indicators, also
matter.

The answer to this latter question has remained
elusive. Table 1 summarizes the results of several
inﬂuential studies; the inconsistency is striking. Some
studies have found that state economic variables
affect gubernatorial approval (Atkeson and Partin
1995; Jacobson 2006; Niemi, Stanley, and Vogel
1995); others have found that they do not (Crew
and Weiher 1996; Peltzman 1987); and still others
have found the effect to be contingent on some other
factor (Ebeid and Rodden 2006; Leyden and Borrelli
1995; Stein 1990). These inconsistencies may arise
from a widespread but implicit assumption that if
local conditions matter, all voters will objectively take
equal account (or non-account) of
them when
evaluating the governor—an assumption at serious
odds with the work on partisanship and bias refer-
enced above.

Those arguing that only national conditions
affect gubernatorial popularity imply, in effect, that
voters blame the president for every policy outcome,
at any level, and evaluate all subnational politicians
based solely on the president’s performance.1 Those
arguing that local conditions also matter imply that
voters have some standard by which to assign
responsibility for some policies to the governor even
while assigning responsibility for other policies to the

1This may read as a straw man, but it is frequently implied in the
gubernatorial elections literature. Peltzman’s words provide one
example: ‘‘[Americans] vote as if they understand that national
rather than local policies have the dominant effect on their
income’’ (1987, 296).

president. As noted earlier, the major argument at
present is that voters assign blame based on the
president’s and governor’s actual responsibilities:
voters perceive objective differences between the
duties of presidents and governors and vote accord-
ingly. This explanation omits partisan bias entirely,
predicting instead that all voters will attribute re-
sponsibility for the same issues to the same ofﬁcials.
My argument modiﬁes this functional responsi-
bility hypothesis by introducing insights from the
literature on partisanship and bias. I do not attempt
to displace the functional responsibility claims en-
tirely; when gubernatorial and presidential responsi-
bilities are clearly delineated, we may well observe
voter behaviors roughly consistent with the func-
tional responsibility argument. But when responsi-
bilities are unclear, as is often the case, the functional
responsibility mechanism cannot logically operate. In
this situation, I expect the literature on partisanship
and bias to become relevant. Rudolph (2003) has
already shown that partisan considerations affect
whether a voter will blame Congress or the president
for national economic problems. My central claim is
that American federalism creates a similar blame
game between governors and the president: voters
will tend to blame whichever level of government that
is not controlled by their own party.

Recently, Malhotra and Kuo (2008) published the
results of an experimental survey that illustrates my

information about

argument. In their poll, they asked respondents to
attribute blame among federal, state, and local ofﬁ-
cials for the government’s poor response to Hurricane
Katrina. Respondents were randomly assigned to
receive different
these ofﬁcials.
When provided with information about each ofﬁcial’s
responsibilities, voters tended to assign blame in a
manner consistent with the functional responsibility
hypothesis. But when provided only with each ofﬁ-
cial’s partisan afﬁliation, respondents tended to blame
ofﬁcials from the opposite party. These experimental
results reinforce my claim that voters will rely on
partisan shortcuts when functional responsibilities are
unclear.

I conﬁrm and expand these experimental ﬁndings
by examining real-world data in another policy area
where functional
responsibilities are particularly
murky: economics. Even the functional responsibility
theorists disagree as to whether governors or presi-
dents bear responsibility for economic conditions,
illustrating just how imprecise the division of labor
is.2 Because functional responsibility for the economy
is ambiguous, I expect voters to assign blame in a
partisan manner—but only when the governor and
president belong to different parties. In the absence of

2Atkeson and Partin (1995) assign all economic responsibility to
governors; Carsey and Wright (1998) argue that presidents bear
national economic responsibility while governors are responsible
only for the state’s economic health relative to the nation’s.

this divided federalism, voter partisanship should not
make much difference. Stated precisely: When the
governor and the president belong to different parties,
voter partisanship should strongly inﬂuence whether
voters will blame the governor instead of the president
for a particular policy outcome.

I test this general argument by exploring three of
its observable implications. First, I begin with a
reanalysis of Stein’s (1990) study of the 1982 guber-
natorial elections, in which voters were asked explic-
itly to assign blame for state economic problems to
either the president or their governor. As it happens,
voters do indeed assign blame in a more partisan
manner under divided federalism. Second, I use
recent polling data to show that partisan consider-
ations also inﬂuence whether respondents think their
state’s economy is outperforming the nation’s; under
divided federalism, voters overestimate the economic
performance of whichever level of government that
their party controls. Third and most importantly, I
address the major question of the gubernatorial elec-
tions literature—namely, whether voters hold gover-
nors accountable for state-level economic conditions.
The widely used functional responsibility argument
implies that all voters should do so. By contrast, I ﬁnd
that partisan biases determine whether state econom-
ics correlate with gubernatorial approval—a pattern
that may explain the mixed ﬁndings summarized in
Table 1.

Partisanship and Blame

to whether

Stein (1990) was the ﬁrst to recognize that voters
might disagree as
the president or
governor bore responsibility for the state’s economy.
Nevertheless, he did not seek to explain this hetero-
geneity, choosing instead to treat blame as exoge-
nous. By revisiting the 1982 exit poll data that he
used, however, we can see clear evidence that parti-
sanship strongly inﬂuences attributions of blame.
Table 2 replicates one of Stein’s tables, summarizing
how voters in each state chose to assign blame for the
state’s economy. Only in California, New York, and
Nevada did more respondents blame their governor
than blamed Ronald Reagan.

By contrast, Table 3 presents the same data
divided by partisan subgroup, an analytic step Stein
did not take. This simple change makes it apparent
that blame strongly reﬂects respondent partisanship.
In every state with a Democratic governor, Repub-
licans blamed their governors and Democrats blamed
Reagan, a Republican; in every state with a Repub-

lican governor, Republicans blamed neither Reagan
nor the governor, and Democrats blamed Reagan or
(more frequently) both. And across
the board,
Republicans were more likely to claim that neither
Reagan nor the governor was to blame, or perhaps
that there were no problems to blame on anybody—a
pattern that may reﬂect some weaknesses with the
survey question.3

Once we take account of respondent partisanship
in this manner, respondents with Democratic gover-
nors showed broad consensus in their decisions about
blame; Democrats blamed Reagan alone by a 40.3
point margin, while Republicans blamed the gover-
nor alone by a 20.3 point margin, which combine for
a net partisan effect of 60.6 percentage points. Mean-
respondents with Republican governors

in (respondent’s state): President Reagan, Governor (name),
both, or neither?’’ Perhaps some who said ‘‘neither’’ thought
there were no economic problems—or at least, they did not want
to admit that Republican leaders had failed them. Or perhaps
they thought that economic problems arose independently of
government policies. The latter explanation would be consistent
with Rudolph’s (2003) work, which shows that economically
conservative respondents will blame labor or business leaders for
economic conditions, given the opportunity to do so, regardless
of partisan considerations—although economic conservatism
does tend to correlate with Republicanism.

showed far less agreement. Democrats continued to
favor blaming Reagan, but by only half the margin
(23.9 points); by contrast, Republicans were torn
between blaming Reagan and the governor, blaming
governors by an inconsequential 1.3 point margin. To
quantify the effect of partisanship on attributions of
blame, note that the difference in differences is 60.6
points in states with Democratic governors but only
25.3 points in states with Republican governors;
respondent partisanship had a much weaker effect
in the latter set of states than in the former.

It appears, then, that respondent partisanship
shaped attributions of blame in 1982; in turn, Stein’s
important work shows that these attributions deter-
mined whether economic conditions affected gover-
nors on election day. These partisan patterns were
most obvious under divided federalism, since re-
spondents could choose to blame either the Demo-
cratic governor or the Republican president. Without
divided federalism, the patterns were far weaker; with
both the governor and the president belonging to the

same party, respondents were less sure whether to
blame both or neither. Respondent partisanship
mattered much more under divided federalism than
elsewhere in determining allocations of blame.

Partisanship and Economic

Evaluations

The 2006 gubernatorial elections took place in a
similar context as the 1982 elections: The economy
was generally weak, and the president was a Repub-
lican. This similarity affords us the methodologically
important opportunity to test whether patterns ob-
served in one context (the 1982 elections) also
occurred in another (the 2006 elections). Although
pollsters in 2006 did not ask an explicit blame question
like they did in 1982, though, they did ask questions
that ought to reﬂect other observable implications of
my theoretical argument. In particular, respondents to

the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)
were asked to evaluate their state’s and the nation’s
economies.4 As discussed earlier, previous research has
shown that presidential approval strongly inﬂuences
evaluations of the national economy. As a straightfor-
ward extension of this insight, under divided feder-
alism we should expect economic evaluations to favor
whichever level of government that is controlled by a
respondent’s preferred party.

To address this question requires survey data in
which respondents evaluate their state’s economy
relative to their nation’s—not their state economy
alone. Under divided federalism, we should observe
strong partisan biases; members of the governor’s
party should overestimate the state economy’s health
relative to the nation’s, while members of the presi-
dent’s party should do the opposite. Without divided
federalism, we should not observe this pattern; all
respondents should be equally likely to over- or
underestimate the state’s health relative to the nation’s.
Unfortunately, pollsters do not typically ask for
such relative evaluations of the state economy as
compared to the nation’s. Nevertheless, we can easily
construct such a relative measure from the CCES
data. Respondents evaluated their state’s economic
health over the previous year; they answered a similar
question about the national economy. Both questions
used a closed-form response ranging over a 5-point
scale from ‘‘much better’’ and ‘‘better’’ to ‘‘worse’’
and ‘‘much worse.’’ By subtracting national evalua-
tions from state evaluations, we can construct an
index measure of each respondent’s evaluation of the
state’s economy relative to the nation’s. This new
measure ranges from 24 (the state economy is much
worse than the national economy) to +4, though
scores fall between 22 and +2 (inclusive) for 97% of
respondents.5 This variable is almost perfectly nor-
mal, with mean 20.07 and standard deviation 1.03,

4Polimetrix ﬁelded the CCES during the November 2006 elec-
tions under the direction of Stephen Ansolabehere, Doug Rivers,
and Lynn Vavreck. This survey involved over 30,000 respondents
answering questions on dozens of topics. For details, see http://
web.mit.edu/polisci/portl/cces/.

5Because respondents have only ﬁve options when evaluating
either the state or national economy,
it is possible that an
extremely optimistic respondent could give the highest score to
the nation but ﬁnd herself unable to give an even higher score to
the state. To verify that this potentiality did not skew any of the
results below, I repeated all these analyses omitting the 4,474
respondents who gave the best (or worst) possible evaluation
both to their state and to the nation; the substantive conclusions
were the same.

indicating that respondents do not systematically
favor one level of the economy over the other.

An advantage of this composite measure is that it
has a correct answer that respondents should have
given, regardless of personal political beliefs: Either
the state economy was stronger than the national
economy or it was not. In a world of objective,
informed citizens, raw economic indicators would
predict most (or all) of the variance in this measure.
Such objectivity seems to be assumed in three of the
most widely read studies dealing with gubernatorial
approval—that is, Atkeson and Partin (1995), Carsey
and Wright (1998), and Stein (1990). In these three
studies, the authors attempt to learn whether gover-
nors are held accountable for state-level economic
conditions; in all three studies, the authors measure
state economic conditions using respondent evalua-
tions of the state economy rather than using raw
macroeconomic indicators. This method is not prob-
lematic as long as respondent evaluations actually
measure the true pulse of the state’s economy—a
proposition that the theoretical arguments presented
above should lead us to question. By contrast,
if
partisan biases inﬂuence respondent economic eval-
uations, then regressing gubernatorial approval on
economic evaluations as these three studies do might
not be much different from regressing gubernatorial
approval on itself.

Table 4 presents the results of two linear regres-
sions that test these ideas. In each, the dependent

with Republican governors; all three estimated co-
efﬁcients fall between 0.10 and 0.17. For these three
types of respondent, actual economic conditions
clearly had a meaningful effect on their economic
evaluations, but not an overwhelming one; a one-
point rise in a state’s unemployment rate relative to
the nation’s would produce only a modest (0.10–
0.17) drop in respondents’ evaluations of the state’s
economy relative to the nation’s.6 For Republicans
with Democratic governors, however, the estimated
effect is two to three times stronger at 20.38.

This interactive ﬁnding does not

imply that
Republicans are necessarily more objective than
Democrats;
if that were the case, the interaction
would not be limited to states with divided feder-
alism. Rather, it shows that partisanship and feder-
alism interact to inﬂuence how respondents assign
blame for policy problems in their states. Republicans
with Democratic governors had every reason to
blame their governor for high unemployment in
2006; the alternative was blaming their Republican
president. By contrast, Democrats with Democratic
governors had an opportunity to shift some of the
responsibility for their state’s economic conditions to

the president, resulting in a decreased coefﬁcient for
this group.

More broadly, the general ﬁnding in this table is
that respondent partisanship produces stronger per-
ceptual biases under divided federalism than else-
where. Where the governor and the president
belonged to different parties, partisanship had a
strong effect on respondent evaluations of the state’s
economy relative to the nation’s; where the governor
and the president belonged to the same party,
partisanship had almost no effect.7 These patterns
are consistent with those reported in the previous
section.

Gubernatorial Approval and

Economic Conditions

I now turn to the gubernatorial approval literature’s
major debate: whether voters hold governors respon-
sible for state-level economic conditions. As sum-
marized in Table 1 earlier, previous research has been
unable to show conclusively whether state economic
conditions inﬂuence gubernatorial popularity. My
results thus far suggest a possible reason for the
literature’s mixed results. First, I have shown that
voters assign responsibility for the state economy in a
partisan manner—particularly under divided feder-
alism. Second, I have shown that voters form per-
ceptions of
the state’s economy relative to the
nation’s in a partisan manner—particularly under
divided federalism. Together, these results imply that
the statistical relationship between state economic
conditions and gubernatorial approval will be medi-
ated by
voter partisanship—particularly under
divided federalism.

The 2006 CCES survey included questions about
gubernatorial approval, making a test of this claim
possible. CCES respondents appraised their respec-
tive governors along a 4-point scale, from ‘‘strongly
disapprove’’ and ‘‘disapprove’’
to ‘‘approve’’ and
‘‘strongly approve.’’8 Although many variables may
affect approval, the focus here is on the governor’s

6Unemployment rates have a standard deviation of 1.04; these
economic evaluations have a standard deviation of 1.03. As such,
these marginal coefﬁcients are roughly equivalent to standardized
coefﬁcients.

7Note that this does not mean that there are no partisan biases in
states governed by the president’s party, only that there is no bias
toward (or against) the state as opposed to the nation.

variable worth investigating because it has produced
such inconsistent results in previous research.9

the ﬁrst model covers

for predicting this ordinal

Table 5 presents the results of four regressions.
The ﬁrst two use ordered logit; the next two estimate
the same models using ordinary least squares. In each
pair,
states with divided
federalism (i.e., Democratic governors in 2006) and
the next covers the remaining states. The dependent
variable is the respondent’s evaluation of the governor.
Strictly speaking, ordered logit would be the most
appropriate tool
four-
category variable. However, OLS gives substantively
similar results; because it is easier to interpret, I will
restrict my discussion below to the two OLS models.
The most important variable is each state’s unemploy-
ment rate, interacted with partisanship.10 As predicted,
the effect of state economic performance is not
constant across partisan subgroups. Under divided
federalism, there is a strong, statistically signiﬁcant
partisan interaction; the state’s unemployment rate
had a clear effect on gubernatorial approval among
Republican respondents but no measurable effect
among Democratic respondents. Without divided
federalism, by contrast, Republican and Democratic
respondents were statistically indistinguishable.

Table 6 replicates the preceding analysis using
gubernatorial approval data gathered at a different
point in time (early 2006) by a different organization
(SurveyUSA).11 The independent variables are state
unemployment rates and state-level approval ratings
for George W. Bush among the speciﬁed partisan
subgroup. The approval and unemployment measures
are averages covering January through March 2006.12

9Careful readers might object to my use of unemployment by
reference to the ‘‘issue ownership’’ literature, pointing out that
Democrats own the issue of unemployment (Petrocik 1992).
Nevertheless, the nature of my ﬁndings suggests that more than
issue ownership is at work. Issue ownership would lead us to
expect Democratic governors (not Republican governors) to be
held accountable for unemployment, regardless of presidential
party; we might also expect Democratic respondents to care more
than Republican respondents about unemployment. Together,
these expectations would lead us to predict patterns very different
from those I ﬁnd.

10State unemployment rates are averaged over the six months
preceding the survey. Demographic control variables include
respondent income and dummies for race, marriage, sex, educa-
tion, home ownership, and employment status. Louisiana is
omitted because of its political and economic volatility following
Hurricane Katrina

11Approval ratings are measured only among those expressing an
opinion. Louisiana is again omitted. Brown (2008) and Jacobson
(2006) discuss SurveyUSA’s reliability and validity.

12This decision was arbitrary but not consequential; when using
data from other periods in the SurveyUSA series, the results are
essentially the same. See Brown (2008).

New Jersey and Virginia are omitted, since they held
gubernatorial elections in November 2005, and their
new governors were only beginning their terms during
this period.

The estimated effects of state unemployment
rates on gubernatorial approval are the coefﬁcients
of greatest theoretical interest. Again, partisan differ-
ences are strong under divided federalism but weak
and insigniﬁcant elsewhere. Because SurveyUSA re-
leases only aggregate approval data, I cannot run the
same interactive models as in Table 5, nor can I
include the same demographic controls. Nevertheless,
the partisan differences are apparent. As in Table 5,
where the governor was a Democrat, Republicans
held their governors accountable for high unemploy-
ment but Democrats did not; elsewhere, there was
not a signiﬁcant partisan pattern.

We can observe the same pattern yet again in a
replication of Carsey and Wright’s (1998) model of
the effects of state economic evaluations on guberna-
torial voting. The ﬁrst column in Table 7 reprints
their ﬁnal logit estimates of the effect of respondent
evaluations of the state economy on the probability of
voting for the incumbent gubernatorial candidate.
Although their analysis (and my replication) contains
several additional variables, I display only one co-
efﬁcient from each logit model—the estimated mar-
ginal effect of respondent economic evaluations.
When I estimate these regressions separately by
respondent party in the latter two columns of the
table, the importance of divided federalism again
becomes apparent. Table 7 tells the same story as
Tables 5 and 6: in states with divided federalism, the
estimated effect of state economic conditions on
gubernatorial voting was more than three times as
strong among the president’s copartisans as among
the governor’s. In states without divided federalism,
there was no meaningful partisan difference.

This interactive ﬁnding in Tables 5, 6, and 7
might seem odd if not for the other results discussed
earlier in this paper. Recall
that under divided
federalism, respondents can choose to blame either
their governor or the president for high unemploy-
ment. As Table 3 shows, members of the president’s
party living under divided federalism are the group
that is most likely to choose to blame the governor
for state-level economic problems. And as Table 4
shows, this is the same group of respondents that
is likely to sharply adjust its state economic evalua-
tions downward when confronted with poor eco-
nomic performance. In light of these two earlier
ﬁndings, it is hardly surprising that this same group

are governors responsible for the state economy?

Discussion

The preceding analysis leads to three major conclu-
sions. First, partisanship has a strong inﬂuence on how
voters assign responsibility for policy outcomes. When
functional responsibilities are shared among ofﬁcials
from opposing parties, voters assign blame in a
partisan manner; they do not assign blame objectively
based only on each ofﬁcial’s job description. Second,
partisanship also inﬂuences how voters perceive policy
performance by various levels of government. When
the president and the governor belong to opposing
parties, voters will overestimate the policy success of
whichever level of government that is controlled by
their preferred party. And third, partisanship inﬂuen-

ces whether voters will hold the governor accountable
for the state economy. The effect of state economics
on gubernatorial approval varies among partisan
subgroups—but only when the president and the
governor belong to different parties. This latter con-
clusion follows logically from the ﬁrst two.

For several years, researchers have struggled to
show whether voters hold governors accountable for
national or state-level conditions. This question
certainly merits attention;
if governors—the most
prominent elected ofﬁcials after the president—are
evaluated largely on the basis of national partisan
trends, then we ought to seriously reconsider the
nature and value of subnational elections. Despite the
importance of
this question, however, previous
research has produced inconsistent results. The pre-
ceding analysis suggests a reason why: the existing
literature on gubernatorial approval has failed to
appreciate the importance of respondent partisanship

in mediating the relationship between policy per-
formance and gubernatorial approval. The ‘‘func-
tional responsibility’’ theory that motivates much of
the work on gubernatorial approval assumes that all
voters will act the same, regardless of party—an
assumption at odds with long-established ﬁndings
in the literature on partisanship and bias.

Of course, I would not go so far as to claim that
every existing analysis would have found a signiﬁcant
relationship between state economic conditions and
gubernatorial approval if only it had fully accounted
for partisanship and divided federalism; after all,
idiosyncratic features of a particular state or year
may temporarily reduce the salience to voters of the
state’s economy (cf. Zaller 1992). That being said,
scholarly inattention to partisanship and divided
federalism may well explain some of the literature’s
inconsistency. The prevalence of divided federalism
has varied widely over the past 50 years, ﬂuctuating
from a high of 74% of states to a low of 26% of states
being governed by the president’s party. Suppose
these year-to-year variations, a
that, because of
particular
study happened to disproportionately
sample states with divided federalism. If most re-
spondents in those states belonged to the president’s
party, then the analysis would be more likely to ﬁnd a
relationship between economics and approval; if not,
then the opposite would be true.

The only way to know for sure whether such was
actually the case would be to replicate every existing
study. For practical reasons, I have not done so.
Nevertheless, I derive some conﬁdence in the robust-
ness of my ﬁndings from the diversity of data sources
examined in this analysis. In various parts of this
paper I have used the 1982 CBS/New York Times exit
polls, the 1986 CBS/New York Times exit polls, the
2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, and
2006 gubernatorial approval data from SurveyUSA;
in every case, the data produced results consistent
with my theory. Along the way, I have replicated
portions of two widely read studies—Stein’s (1990)

and Carsey and Wright’s (1998)—and found results
consistent with my theory.

Federalism plays a central role in American
voting behavior. Subnational elections are not held
in a vacuum, but rather in the context of national
political conditions. However, this analysis demon-
strates that federalism’s role differs somewhat from
what researchers have previously thought. Recent
research has argued that voters hold state and federal
ofﬁcials accountable for different sets of issues; in this
line of
thinking, voters recognize that state and
federal ofﬁcials have differing policy responsibilities
and judge them accordingly. Such an argument
presupposes that the lines dividing federal from state
authority are clear. Although state and federal powers
may have been neatly divided at America’s founding,
the divisions are now extremely blurred—especially
in the realm of economic policy.

My ﬁndings do not necessarily refute the func-
tional responsibility argument entirely; the functional
responsibility hypothesis may explain voter behavior
in issue areas where responsibilities are more clear-cut,
as implied by Malhotra and Kuo’s ﬁndings (2008). But
at least in issue areas where responsibility is uncertain,
such as economic policy, voters rely instead on
partisan cues when assigning blame for policy out-
comes. Presidential, gubernatorial, and respondent
partisanship interact to determine how voters assess
gubernatorial performance. When it suits their parti-
san predispositions, voters blame their governor for
state-level problems; when it does not, they do not.

In addition, this partisan logic also affects voter
judgments of policy outcomes. Partisan biases have
clear, meaningful effects on respondent evaluations of
the state’s economic health. A handful of well-
regarded studies have used correlations between
retrospective economic evaluations and gubernatorial
approval to argue that voters do, in fact, hold gov-
ernors responsible for the state’s economy (Atkeson
and Partin 1995, 1998; Carsey and Wright 1998; Stein
1990). But given that retrospective evaluations are

strongly inﬂuenced by respondent partisanship, po-
litical scientists should hesitate to use retrospective
economic evaluations as indicators of actual eco-
nomic performance.
