{"text": "Since 1988, more than 20 US military bases have been redesignated as national wildlife refuges. In order to understand the processes of these military-to-wildlife (M2W) conversions and their implications, I examine three logics that help to produce these particular changes: Biodiversity, Brownﬁelds, and Serendipity. These logics contribute to a broader discourse of ecological militarization that frames military practices as compatible with and contributing to environmental protection. I focus on the case of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Colorado, USA, to examine how these logics of conversion are mobilized into practice, and what such changes mean as they bring militarism and environmental conservation together in reconﬁgured spaces. lations (DOD Base Closure and Realignment Commission Report 2005). Of these, nearly two dozen bases on more than one million acres (400,000 ha) have been redesignated as new national wildlife refuges (Wyman 2003; Osugi 2004)(Figs. 1 and 2). As units within the U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System, these refuges add to the United States’ largest network of federal public lands dedicated primarily to the conservation of plants, wildlife, and habitat (see Fischman 2003).", "metadata": "m2w_0"}
{"text": "1 Thus, the transformation of military lands into national wildlife refuges presents a prospective opening of restricted military spaces into public places dedicated to environmental conservation. In addition to hundreds of species of plants and animals, however, many of these places also include areas heavily contaminated by chemicals, explosives, and other residues of military activity. As a result of these mixed features of militarism and conservation, hazards and habitat, sites of military-to-wildlife (M2W) conversion represent new kinds of places with a unique suite of issues for land managers, elected ofﬁcials, social scientists, conservationists, and others to consider. As new geographies that blend environmental and military characteristics, the sites that emerge from these reclassiﬁcations are both material places—the new wildlife refuges—and new conceptions of places developed through an integration of history, science, politics, and environmental discourse. In this paper, I turn to the historical production of M2W conversion sites to examine how certain narratives have coalesced into logics of change. My research draws broadly upon M2W conversions occurring across the United States, the Caribbean, and in the Paciﬁc, but I focus here primarily upon the conversion of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Colorado, USA (Fig. 3).", "metadata": "m2w_1"}
{"text": "2 At this site and elsewhere, I seek to understand how the conversion of a military installation into a wildlife refuge is commonly explained. These explanations are often rooted in three distinct logics or narratives that I identify as Biodiversity, Brownﬁelds, and Serendipity. By illuminating these logics and exploring the deeper historical and political productions that have taken place at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal—including why this particular site was chosen, how it developed as a chemical manufacturing facility, and what then allowed it to ‘make sense’ as a national wildlife refuge—I suggest that we may better understand the nature of the change occurring here. This, in turn, can help us understand militarism and conservation as these seemingly disparate spheres converge to create new kinds of places. The casting of military production as fundamentally compatible with environmental protection stands as a key principal that promotes M2W conversions and explains in part why many elected ofﬁcials, land managers, and environmentalists consider such redesignations as ‘win–win–win’ scenarios. On this view, the DOD streamlines its assets with base closures, the public receives open space amenities and new sites for environmental education or recreation, and ﬁsh and wildlife populations gain additional habitat reserves.", "metadata": "m2w_2"}
{"text": "This typecasting of the military’s compatibility with the environment—what I label ‘ecological militarization’—merits critique on at least three counts. There is, for one, a considerable degree of subjectivity in characterizations of healthy ecosystems or thriving wildlife in this particular context. Deer grow to impressive stature within the Rocky Mountain Arsenal’s fences and face few natural predators, but does this isolation and longevity truly indicate ecosystem health? How, for example, does the abundance of deer, raptors, or small mammals correlate to episodes of waterfowl mortality on the Arsenal’s ponds, elevated levels of heavy metals in the tissue of kestrels and other species, or the periodic lethal encounters between Arsenal wildlife and acutely toxic substances still extant on the site? How does one accurately assess whether these various conditions qualify an ecosystem as ‘healthy’ or ‘thriving’? Considering the portrait of military–environmental compatibility more systemically, we also encounter a certain disconnect between the underlying purposes to which military installations and wildlife refuges are directed: the former toward the taking/defense of territory or lives by force, the latter as peaceful sanctuary.", "metadata": "m2w_3"}
{"text": "Military landscapes are not simply collections of physical attributes where we ﬁnd, in the example of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, shortgrass prairie sprouting around the edges of a chemical weapons plant; rather, as Mitchell (1996), Kuletz (1998), Olwig (2001), Woodward (2004) and others have pointed out, landscapes have politics and value systems built into them. By embracing the wildlife and environmental attributes of M2W conversion sites, we may implicitly also embrace their companion military activities. During its decades of operation, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal produced wildlife habitat and weapons of mass destruction; both of these histories remain present in the landscape that now carries a new name as a wildlife refuge. Institutional representatives of both these histories also remain at the Arsenal. As of February 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) holds title to just two-thirds of the 18,000-acre (7,285 ha) site.", "metadata": "m2w_4"}
{"text": "Approximately half of the remaining land will be transferred from the DOD to the FWS following remediation to create a 15,000-acre (6,000 ha) refuge, but the U.S. Army will perpetually retain ownership, liability, and management obligations for the remaining land, which includes millions of cubic yards of soil contaminated with toxic chemicals (Final Technical Memorandum 2003; Rundle 2004). Considering that the military remains at the Arsenal in this way both materially and legally, the acceptance of ecological militarization may serve to afﬁrm the very practices and systems that generated environmental problems and threats to society over the course of several decades (on military impacts see, for example, Shulman 1992; Barnett 2001; Lutz 2001; Woodward 2004). This third point recalls critiques of the broader discourse of ecological modernization that casts economic growth as compatible with environmental protection (see for example, Huber 1985; Hajer 1995; Dryzek 1997). According to Hajer, since the early 1980s environmental politics has been dominated and characterized by this view that ecological crises can be overcome by technical and procedural innovation (1995, 1996). He considers the possibility that this merely reﬂects a technocratic project that takes real environmental problems and applies false technological solutions (Hajer 1996, pp. 256–257).", "metadata": "m2w_5"}
{"text": "Harvey, in turn, cautions that the win–win appearances of economic and environmental compatibility can ‘easily be corrupted into yet another discursive representation of dominant forms of economic power’ (1996: p. 382). Others make a case for a ‘strong’ form of ecological modernization that challenges the status quo more sincerely and contributes to genuine social change and environmental conservation (see Christoff 1996; Dryzek 1997; Mol and Spaargaren 2000). This strong version can require a change in economic and environmental policy approaches. For example, grassroots and citizen-based knowledge is elevated and integrated into the decision-making process, which in turn can spur what Hajer calls ‘reﬂexive awareness’ that renews debate about what kind of relationships of nature, society, and technology we wish to build (1996, pp. 265–266). At the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, there is in fact a Restoration Advisory Board composed of local community members; Army, FWS, and Shell site managers; and state and federal regulatory agencies. This advisory board is intended to provide a voice in the policy process for diverse constituencies, much as the strong form of ecological modernization would recommend. If applied to the context of M2W conversions, this strong form could lead to diminished militarization.", "metadata": "m2w_6"}
{"text": "Although M2W conversions fail to meet the standard for this stronger version on multiple counts, simply dismissing these changes as superﬁcial examples of ‘greenwashing’ closes down an opportunity to leverage military reclassiﬁcations into a more democratic sphere. In fact, the logics for change that help to produce M2W conversions are not arbitrary rhetorical constructions, but instead emerge from conditions very much in evidence on the ground. They are, in this way, a means of integrating social processes and natural features at these complex, paradoxical locations of military damage and environmental promise. In the next section, I turn more directly to the three logics evident at a number of M2W locations.", "metadata": "m2w_7"}
